## Emotion Detection

A few experiments on emotion detection in texts. Two different datasets are used:
* [Isear dataset](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Characteristics-of-the-ISEAR-Dataset_tbl1_313407834)
* [Crowdflower dataset](https://www.figure-eight.com/data-for-everyone/)


Trying a bunch of models/frameworks:
* LSTM in Keras (tf 2.0)
* Vanilla Transformer in pytorch
